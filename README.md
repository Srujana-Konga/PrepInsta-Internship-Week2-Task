# Frog Leap Puzzle Game

## Overview
The Frog Leap Puzzle is a classic puzzle game where two sets of frogs (left and right) need to switch positions. The left frogs can only move to the right, and the right frogs can only move to the left. The objective is to swap the positions of the two sets of frogs using the allowed movements.

## Rules
1. The left set of frogs can only move to the right, while the right set can only move to the left.
2. Frogs can move forward one space or jump over another frog from the opposite side to move two spaces.
3. The puzzle is solved when the two sets of frogs have completely switched positions.
